### What I learned

To make responsive layout you don't need to use too many breakpoints by using few ones and dynamic layout you can achieve responsiveness. I just hide the desktop image and visible mobile image on small screens I thought I'll have to work on other typography and spacing but no everything is already fine without doing too much.
